## TW_Lang_VisualBasic - VisualBasic.net language module for BBEdit and TextWrangler ##

### Introduction ###

This is a language module for syntax highlighting VisualBasic.NET in [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) and [TextWrangler](https://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/). 

(*Note:* TextWrangler has been retired and is no longer supported; you should be using BBEdit instead, which you can do for free. More detail is available at the TextWrangler product page.)

### Installation ###

For BBEdit and TextWrangler:

1. Locate your "Language Modules" folder. For BBEdit 12.6 and later you can use the "Folders" submenu on the main BBEdit application menu.
2. Copy the file `VisualBasic.plist` to this folder.
3. Quit and relaunch the application.
4. There is no step 4.
